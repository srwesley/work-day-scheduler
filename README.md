# Work Day Scheduler
Assignment application for Week 5 - Third-Party APIs for bootcamp

## Task
Creating a web application to run a simple calendar app that saves events typed into the description boxes for each hour, as well as tracking the actual time of the day and applying the CSS class styles to change the background color of the boxes depending on if it's past, currently, or will be that time. This was also done through modifying starter code.
